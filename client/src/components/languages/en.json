HSA's are administered in accordance with Canada Revenue Agency guidelines.\n\nMore than 55,000 small business owners across Canada utilize a Health Spending Account. It's a viable alternative to traditional health insurance and a cost-effective way to pay for medical expenses. With the plan, business owners can turn personal, after-tax medical expenses into before-tax business expenses.",

  "HSA.LongTermApproach.Detail": "While many employees use these accounts to fund their current-year expenses, their real value comes as an investment vehicle for the future.\n\nUnlike flexible spending accounts, HSAs permit owners to carry balances across calendar years and invest the assets. By paying for current health care expenses out-of-pocket instead, investors are able to invest and grow balances, building significant resources for the future.\n\nBy consistently contributing the maximum annual amount, and investing the balance for future health care costs, one can accumulate a nice tax-free reserve to fund future health care costs. For example, an investment of just $100 per month over 20 years can turn $24,000 into over $56,000 (assumes a 8.0 percent rate of return).",
  "HSA.WhatClaim.Label": "What can group benefits be claimed for?",
  "HSA.WhatClaim.Detail": "The range of qualifying medical expenses is quite broad and includes most common health care costs. Additionally, funds may be used for insurance deductibles and premiums, dental and vision care, and even some surprising options like acupuncture and weight loss programs. When taking distributions from your HSA account to fund care, qualifying withdrawals are 100% tax-free. This includes both the initial contribution and any growth.",

  "Ads.TravelInsurance.Student.FAQ.Question1.Contents": "When it comes to coverage and benefits, it's incomparable to insurance in foreign countries. When you actually compare the insurance premiums, there isn't much of a difference. To cater to customers who are only looking for cheap insurance premiums, we could recommend subpar insurance options. We do have contracts with cheap insurance companies. However, we do not recommend them. Even if it means missing out on many customers, we cannot compromise on that. Such insurance policies do not provide proper coverage. The more we sell such insurance, the worse our reputation will become. At Stonewell, we persist in offering only insurance policies that provide proper coverage. If you are searching for the cheapest insurance company, unfortunately, it will be difficult for us to form a connection.",

  "Ads.TravelInsurance.Student.FAQ.Question2.Contents": "Unfortunately, you cannot be covered. It's because travel insurance does not provide coverage for pre-existing conditions or past incidents. Have you checked with other places? If someone claims they can provide coverage, it's likely a scam, so please be cautious and reject their offer.",
  "Ads.TravelInsurance.Student.FAQ.Question3.Title": "Should I purchase insurance directly from insurance companies?",
  "Ads.TravelInsurance.Student.FAQ.Question3.Contents": "Certainly! You have the option to directly contact the insurance company to purchase insurance. The main difference between buying from them and buying from us lies in the claim process. When you buy from the insurance company, they typically won't assist you with claim submissions. If any issues arise, you would need to handle them independently. On the other hand, when you purchase from us, our expert team is available to provide support whenever you need assistance. Additionally, certain products may even be more expensive when purchased directly from the insurance company compared to buying from us."
